Welcome back to Leeds Kotlin User Group! A Leeds based Kotlin User Group, run by Kotlin enthusiasts for people interested in learning more about Kotlin and the Kotlin Community. 
     
We've been away for awhile but we're looking forward to hosting some more Kotlin meet-ups in early 2020 and beyond! Our first meet-up of the year will involve a few lightening talks about KotlinConf 2019, which was attended by some of our organisers along with 1700 others. The talks will highlight the current state of the Kotlin Language, some of the great work being done in the Kotlin Community and finally other ways that Kotlin can be used. Following the KotlinConf session we'll run an open panel to discuss some of the content that members of the Kotlin Community in Leeds want to see in future meet-ups!
